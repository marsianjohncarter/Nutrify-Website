What is Nutrify?

Nutrify is a food tracking and education app focused on whole foods.

This update brings several helpful features for those who’d like to know what their calorie and macronutrient intakes are per whole food.

It also adds a bunch of new whole foods/drinks to the Nutridex!

Short Version
-------------

Premium updates:

*   Set custom calorie and macronutrient goals alongside food-specific and category-specific goals in the Summary tab.
*   Get a breakdown of calorie and macronutrient intake per food/category in the Calories and Macros views.
*   Simple calorie/macronutrient estimation defaults to 1 serving per food photo (this can be changed in the food view).

Free updates:

*   57 new foods in the FoodVision AI model/Nutridex.

Longer Version
--------------

### Custom Calorie and Macronutrient Goals (Premium)

Nutrify Premium members can now define calorie and macronutrient intake goals and Nutrify will automatically track your progress over time.

When starting a goal, you can define your own calorie and macronutrient values or you can use Nutrify to help establish a baseline goal.

Nutrify comes with 3 built-in goals:

*   Calorie deficit (for weight loss).
*   Maintenance (for maintaining current weight).
*   Calorie surplus (for gaining weight).

Each of these is calculated based on your body characteristics (height, weight, age, gender) as well as your activity level.

You’ll also see an informative page describing the what and why behind each calculation and amount (**disclaimer:** these amounts are estimates and should be adjusted over time when necessary).

The first screen shows a summary with calories consumed (766.6 out of 2,800), macronutrient breakdown (protein, carbs, fats), heart rate (64 BPM), and daily goals (liquor, vegetable, water). The second screen allows setting a calorie goal with an example goal of 2,100 calories, and corresponding macronutrient targets (protein, carbs, fats). The third screen shows monthly macronutrient intake totals for protein (3,578.65g), carbs (6,939.48g), and fats (2,949.70g), with a pie chart breakdown.](https://nutrify.app/images/images-1.2/01-nutrify-calorie-goals-and-breakdowns.png)

Setting a calorie or macronutrient goal is a great way to understand how your current food intake matches up with your ideal intake.

### Calorie and Macronutrient Breakdowns (Premium)

Nutrify Premium members can also now get a breakdown of your calorie and macronutrient intake per food in the new Calories and Macros views.

This is a great way to see what foods contribute to what macronutrient levels.

And similarly, how many calories are in a given serving of food.

When you identify a food with the Nutrify camera, its default weight is set to 1 serving of that food.

For example, the default weight for a red apple is 182g.

And the default weight for a rice cake is 9g (one rice cake).

These can be easily adjusted in the food view.

![Three smartphone screenshots of Nutrify displaying various sections and pages. The first screen shows a daily calorie summary for May 22, 2024, with total calories consumed (766.6 out of 2,800) and specific foods listed: eggs (214.62 calories), cheese (143.14 calories), and rice cakes (117.45 calories). The second screen displays a weekly calorie summary with a total of 16,867.2 calories consumed and categories like dish, meat, dairy, baked goods, and fruit. The third screen shows details for rice cakes, including serving size (30 grams), number of servings, and a brief description of the snack.](https://nutrify.app/images/images-1.2/02-nutrify-calorie-and-macronutrient-breakdowns.png)
