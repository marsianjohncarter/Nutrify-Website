### Keep the whole food streak going

The saying goes, "An apple a day..."

It should really be, "A collection of whole foods a day..."

Because one of the best ways to stay healthy is to maintain good habits over time.

And at Nutrify, we believe eating more whole foods is one of the healthiest habits there is.

95% whole foods (or even more if you can), 5% other.

To help create and support healthy habits, we're introducing the Streak view in the Summary tab.

Nutrify will keep track of how many days in a row you've eaten whole foods.

Whether it's 21 days to build a habit or 66 or 7, when it comes to health, the long-term trend is what matters.

You can also get an overview of your whole food streak with the new Streak widgets on the home screen.
